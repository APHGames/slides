					img.height-400(src=imgAssets+'principle.svg')
			li.fragment To avoid sliding, the geometry must steer the inside front tyre at a larger angle than the outside front
			li.fragment Its premise is based on low-speed turning which applies to sedans. Sports cars tend to be configured toward parallel steer.
